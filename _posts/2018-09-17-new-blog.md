<div class="message">
  We've switched from WordPress (and a single medium post) to this shiny new blog. It uses Jeckyl hosted as static files on GitHub, for nice easy free hosting.

Steve's old [Opening Accessibility"](/openingaccessibility/index.html) WordPress blog has been archived here. It was converted to static HTML using the "simply static" plugin.

Our [Azure Serverless](/azureserverless/index.html) site about Azure Functions WordPress site is also archived here.
