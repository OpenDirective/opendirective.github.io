title: Open communication with symbols
---

<div class="message">
Many people without speech use symbols everyday to aid or enable communication with others. The current COVID pandemic means more find themselves literally speechless while on breathing support such as CPAP or imply too weak to speak. Fortunately there are a growing number of free or open symbols sets and apps.

## AAC

Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) describes a set of techniques and tools that support people who have difficulties communicating, especially if they do not have speech. Such difficulties may result from congenital disabilities such as Cerebral Palsey or may be acquired for example aspasia after a stroke. The basic idea of AAC is to create printed or electronic interactive grids of symbols that capture common needs or thoughts that a person may wish to communicate. The symbols may be use individually or strung into sentences by the user either pointing to them with arm or looking at them. Low tech versions are printed on paper and high tech solutions use 'eye tracking' and speech synthesis.

The serious health impact of COVID19 on some has resulted in more people who find themselves unable to easily express their wishes or communicate with loved ones. While there are several specialist AAC tools on the market there is also a growing number of free and open solutions. This is important as the experts in distilling the entire language needs of someone into a usable set of charts of symbols are Speech and Language Therapists ("SALT"s in the UK) and they are more often or not running on a "shoestring" budget (like most of our Health and Social Care sectors).

## Mulberry Symbols

Sometime ago a took over stewardship of the [Mulberry Symbols](https://mulberrysymbols.org/) which in addition to providing symbols aimed at adult users that are not often available in proprietary sets, are also low cost and freely sharable and modifiable. One of key questions in my mind is how can we make sure that SALTs can easily choose and use the symbols they want for users. While we provide a [downloadable zip archive](https://mulberrysymbols.org/#downloads) of all the symbol files that can be fiddly to create boards with. There is also a "hacky" way to download individual symbols. Often print boards are made using a word processor or presentation software and they have to be opened or dragged into place and then scaled. Use in AAC progress often involves other complexities, including the need to transform the symbols into another format that the program will accept. The Symbols also come with English names which is difficult for use in other languages.

Fortunately there are a growing [number of open solutions](https://mulberrysymbols.org/#the-symbols-in-use) that help address these issues.

## The Open Symbols ecosystem

**Finding Symbols** - Both [Global Symbols](https://blog.globalsymbols.com) and [Open Symbols](https://www.opensymbols.org/) provide online tools for exploring, selecting and downloading symbols from a range of open sets. They also offer other facilities like editing symbols or associated meta data.

**Creating Boards** selecting symbols and placing them into boards is a common requirement. When the board is to be printed Office documents are often used and templates and samples like those from the [CommuniKate project](http://communikate.equalitytime.co.uk/) can be really helpful. AAC apps usually have their own way of designing boards but now the [Open Board Format](https://www.openboardformat.org/) (OBF) initiative is proposing an open and standard board format. This will alow easy interchange of boards between Apps and so  open up the ecosystem for collaboration and innovation. One such app is [BoardBuilder](https://globalsymbols.com/boardbuilder) from Global Symbols which allows you to create and modify boards, print them or export in the OBF format for use in AAC apps. A number of [sample boards](https://blog.globalsymbols.com/en/resources/symbolcharts/) are also provided.

**Creating Symbols** Symbols sets are never complete and the symbols users probably want individualised symbols. After all, the symbols are often a persons main or only language so they want to personal. Open Symbols provided an opportunity for community collaboration on symbols through the flexible permissive licenses that allow free modification. Usually it's good manners to provide new derived symbols back to the symbols set project so others can benefit. Global symbols also provide a little online [symbol creator](https://blog.globalsymbols.com/en/create-symbols/) tool.

**AAC Apps** Both [Cboard](https://www.cboard.io/) and [Coughdrop](https://www.coughdrop.com/) are full featured Open Source AAC Apps. They support speech and 'books' of connected boards where a symbol in one board links to another board, allowing for complex symbol collections.

**Open AAC** The [Open AAC](https://www.openaac.org/) initiative exists to create and encourage open-licensed resources and tools to support AAC users. It supports a number of concepts including the Open Board Format disucssed above.

**Training** Creating useable boards is a skill requiring understanding of language and more. Fortunately, Global Symbols have created a number of free [training resources](https://training.globalsymbols.com/) in collaboration with UNICEF.

## Join in

So in summary, there is a growing ecosystem of open symbols and tools. Not only do these provide low cost solutions but they also enable collaborative community development so we can better support AAC users. Please join us!
