		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Karen. I don&#039;t think size matters so much (ehm), but a blog post does feel somehow more permanent than a tweet. Tweets seem very much of the moment. Being constrained to 140 leads to one kind of creativeness, where-as a blog post feels like a nice wide open space.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Welcome! I sympathize with the 140 problem. I still haven&#039;t pushed myself to throw those slightly bigger thoughts onto my blog. I keep thinking a blog post has to have a certain size. Maybe knowing that you are giving this a try will be a push for me, too? I hope so! Cheers!]]></description>
