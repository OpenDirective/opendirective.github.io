		<description><![CDATA[Hi all, i&#039;ve had the same problem. 

cp: cannot stat ‘../../../backup-flame/system/lib/modules/ath6kl-3.5/ath6kl_sdio.ko’: No such file or directory
Failed to pull ath6kl_sdio.ko. Giving up.

The file seems to be missing, so the build backup won&#039;t be able to find it. My solution was to simply comment out the matching line in
device/t2m/flame/extract-files.sh
line 186:
#copy_files &quot;$COMMON_WIFI_VOLANS&quot; &quot;system/lib/modules/ath6kl-3.5&quot; &quot;wifi&quot;

So build backup won&#039;t look for the file.
Afterwards build works fine. I don&#039;t think this file is actually neccessary as wifi works with my build too. ;)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Actually I&#039;m confused, the link to &quot;the FirefoxOS 1.2 provided by ZTE&quot; does seem to work. To build 2.1 just change &#039;BRANCH=v1.4&#039; to BRANCH=v2.1&quot; in the build instructions. Note how ever at some point the mozilla builds change to use Android Lollipop and not KitKat as provided by ZTE - so won&#039;t work.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[My understanding is the Open C is much better supported by the ZTE. You don;t say what file you can&#039;t find but try the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ztedevices.com/support/smart_phone/46d40c52-bed4-4cdc-9df9-01719cdf0a70.html?type=software&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;ZTE support pages&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.comebuy.com/developer-firefox-os-open-c.html://&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide/ZTE_OPEN_C&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;MDN page&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
