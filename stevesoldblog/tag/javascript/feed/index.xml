				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[ Update 2016-10-23 the code is now in the <a href="https://github.com/cyclejs-community/cycle-serverless">cyclejs community repo</a>]</p>
<p>During development of my latest SaaS product, Brian, I&#8217;ve settled on a couple of key architectural decisions. For the Frontend I&#8217;m using Reactive programming (RP) with streams and for the backend I&#8217;ve decided on the &#8216;Serverless&#8217; (FaaS) approach. Specifically, I&#8217;m using  Andre Stalz&#8217;s <a href="http://staltz.com/xstream">xstream</a> with the incredibly light &#8216;framework&#8217; <a href="https://cycle.js.org/">cyclejs</a> (but cyclejs supports other streaming libs, including the excellent <a href="https://rxjs.codeplex.com/">RxJS</a>) . Microsoft&#8217;s <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/">Azure Functions</a> give a FaaS solution backed-up by many other options including BaaS &amp; PaaS should they be required. This post looks at using them together on the backend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy that the trade-offs and benefits with these approaches should meet my requirements. Namely, achieving  rapid development by focussing energy higher &#8216;up the stack&#8217;. I want to concentrate on innovation of user features and &#8216;business logic&#8217; and not boilerplate or DevOps. From my early explorations I think Serverless and cyclejs manage to hit sweet spots of benefit and learning curve. However, they are most definitely not silver bullets, having wrinkles all their own that take time and effort to learn and overcome.</p>
<p>When I initially created Functions code using a traditional imperative style I rapidly found I missed the RP style I&#8217;d become familiar with when using CycleJS with RxJS. It&#8217;s a style that gets under your skin once you make the mental shift. Perhaps my background in real-time async communications predisposes me to seeing the benefits of asynchronous handling of streams. But whatever, I thought it would be fun to try it in the serverless context. At least both front and back ends would then be similar in architecture.</p>
<p>You may wonder why on earth I would consider using RP in a FaaS context. After all, the  FaaS architecture is all about small functions which are run once triggered and then quickly end. Thus, it would seem there isn&#8217;t much scope for streams when there is single trigger input event plus perhaps another data source or two.  One often touted advantage of RP is that it&#8217;s pure functions are easier to test, but that&#8217;s also a recommend practice with FaaS so that&#8217;s not an obvious advantage for having RP as well as FaaS.</p>
<p>One reason for wanting to use RP is that any non trivial functions are likely to have other asynchronous event sources, including SaaS requests and database updates over REST. Even so, there are other less tangible benefits of RP with cyclejs that I personally I found over imperative code style:</p>
<ul>
<li>Loose coupling through reactive observers</li>
<li>Declarative style married to functional programming techniques</li>
<li>Separation of input, output side effects from the &#8220;pure&#8221; business logic</li>
</ul>
<p>Together these engender a clean high-level way to describe program logic. Bugs also appear to be reduced and it also enables testing without excessive mocking due to the absence of side effects in the main code. Sometimes however, debugging can be more involved due to current tooling supporting imperative and not reactive. However, tooling is starting to appear as more turn to RP.</p>
<p>So what are the differences found when running xstream and cyclejs on Azure Functions environment compared to the usual browser (and sometimes nodejs) contexts?Surprisingly few it turns out. Fortunately, Functions builds on Azure Web Apps which supports nodejs and express. Better, it&#8217;s node 6.x that is provided which includes all those key ES6 features that really help clean up RP code. Another plus is that the cycle HTTP driver works fine on node.</p>
<p>In this implementation I&#8217;ve taken the approach of providing a cycle runtime in each Azure Function. Effectively, each Function is a component in the cycle sense of the word, though connections between components will have to be via HTTP, queues or other out of process couplings. This approach seems to be the a good choice as you can use Cyclejs or not for any individual function, depending on the complexity and preferences. As the Functions run time is open source there is scope to explore different and more deeply embedded approaches.</p>
<p>So without further a-do here&#8217;s the Functions driver code.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">const xs = require('xstream').default

module.exports = function makeFunctionsDriver(context, dispwrap, inArgs) {

    function driver(s$) {
        s$.addListener({ next: (i) =&gt; { setTimeout(() =&gt; {  // next tick to allow other listenerns to be iterated
                                            context.res = i 
                                            if (dispwrap &amp;&amp;
                                                typeof dispwrap.disposer === 'function') {
                                                dispwrap.disposer()
                                            }
                                            context.done()
                                            }, 1)
                         },   
                         error: () =&gt; {},
                         complete: () =&gt; {}
        })

        return xs.createWithMemory({
            start: listener =&gt; {
                setTimeout(() =&gt; {listener.next({context, inArgs})}, 1)
            },
            stop: () =&gt; {},
        })

  
    }

    const logger = a =&gt; context.log(a)
    return {driver, logger}
}</pre><p>As with all drivers, the Function driver is there to handle useful side effects such as input and output. In this case it converts the Function inputs (&#8220;context&#8221; and an array of input bindings) into a source stream. It also sinks a stream containing the function&#8217;s output. This also acts as a signal that the function should complete (the driver calls context.done).  The sink also disposes of the streams created by run() for cleanup (this adds a little implementation complexity due to a forward declaration and JS&#8217;s lack of true pass-by-reference).</p>
<p>It turns out that using console.log is not useful in Functions, rather the alternative context.log is used. Thus, we also provide a Log driver that uses this channel. This is also used with xstream&#8217;s debug operator, which fortunately accepts a function argument as well as a value. I also decided the FunctionsDriver factory would return the log function itself as well as the driver. In this way nearly all the FaaS platform dependencies are encapsulated in the driver. This makes it possible to write a version for AWS Lamda or other serverless frameworks.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example usage for a HTTP Function. It starts a 1 second ticker and on the 3rd tick makes a REST API request. It then returns the first item from the response in function output. The code demonstrates the use of all the driver features and the clarity of RP with cyclejs.</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">const xs = require('xstream').default
const run = require('@cycle/xstream-run').run
const makeHTTPDriver = require('@cycle/http').makeHTTPDriver
const makeFunctionsDriver = require('./functionsDriver.js')

module.exports = function (context, ...inArgs) {
    const dispwrap = {}             // because JS doesn't do pass-by-ref
    const {driver: functionsDriver, logger} = makeFunctionsDriver(context, dispwrap, inArgs)

    const drivers = {
        FaaS: functionsDriver,
        HTTP: makeHTTPDriver(),
        log: msg$ =&gt; { msg$.addListener({next: msg =&gt; logger(`${msg}`) }) }
    }

    dispwrap.disposer = run(main, drivers)
   
    function main(sources) {
        const input$ = sources.FaaS
            .map((s) =&gt; `context.req.originalUrl: ${s.context.req.originalUrl} /
                         inArgs[0]: ${JSON.stringify(s.inArgs[0])}`)
            
        const ticks$ = xs.periodic(1000)
            .map(t =&gt; (t + 1) * 100)
        
        const log$ = xs.merge(input$, ticks$)

        const trigger$ = ticks$
            .drop(2)
            .debug((i) =&gt; logger(`trigger tick: ${i}`))
 
        const request$ = trigger$
            .map(() =&gt; ({
                            url: 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users/1',
                            method: 'GET'
                        }))

        const response$ = sources.HTTP
            .select()
            .flatten()
        const user1Data$ = response$.map(response =&gt; response.body)
        const exit$ = user1Data$
            .map(u =&gt; ({ status: 200, body: u}))

        return {
            FaaS: exit$,
            log: log$,
            HTTP: request$
        }
    }
}</pre><p>One issue that needs to be ironed out is sometimes exceptions such as syntax errors get lost and not presented in the Functions Logs. That&#8217;s probably xstream not re throwing captured exceptions. For now the fix is to put try&#8230;catch(log) blocks around parts of the code to get visibility.</p>
<p>What do you think. Does this approach work for you?</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[Title inspired by a quote from Scott Hanselman on <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WhatIsServerlessComputingExploringAzureFunctions.aspx">Serverless with Azure Functions</a> &#8216;It&#8217;s as close to &#8220;cloudy&#8221; as The Cloud can get&#8217;]</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some big changes happening in web land that are fuelled by rapid app framework developments and advances in cloud land. In particular the system architectural client-server split is shifting. We currently see these architectures (and variations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Classic 3 tier with web server passing presentation to the web browser as linked pages of HTML etc</li>
<li>Ajax-ified with some presentation elements being dynamically requested and updated by the browser or even generated client-side from received data.</li>
<li>Single Page Applications where presentation and navigation are completely generated in the browser which directly accesses various 1st and 3rd party RESTful APIs (SaaS).</li>
<li>The Opera Mini browser Opera Mini is very popular, especially in poorer countries. It is something of  an architectural oddity as it renders  on a display server and uses a thin-client style display protocol to the client app for data efficiency. This is effectively a final stage applied after the others in this list.</li>
<li>GraphQL is becoming popular for API queries as it lets the client dictate the payload and simplifies queries that would require multiple RESTful API round trips</li>
</ul>
<p>SPAs bring web apps into parity with Native Mobile Apps (and even some Desktop apps). The main difference now being the specific client side SDKs used to bind to the messaging protocols such as REST over HTTP.</p>
<p>On the server we see hosting being outsourced at progressively higher levels in the stack: the so called cloudy IaaS, PaaS, BaaS, FaaS and WaaS. In addition, microservices are being used to break up monolithic middle tiers. In the last year we have seen the rise of interest in so called Serverless (BaaS, FaaS and WaaS). This was initiated by the introduction of AWS Lambda, quickly followed by other providers including Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions, OpenWhisk.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14867685775_c7044f0e2e_z.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-694 size-medium" src="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14867685775_c7044f0e2e_z-300x300.jpg" alt="cute pompom spider" width="300" height="300" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14867685775_c7044f0e2e_z-300x300.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14867685775_c7044f0e2e_z-150x150.jpg 150w, /wp-content/uploads/2016/09/14867685775_c7044f0e2e_z.jpg 640w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>So, exiting times for developers! But are these architectural changes eroding core Webby principals, especially the very carefully developed inclusive design principles? What is the impact on web users?</p>
<p>After 25 years the classic web architecture has, with the help of Web standards, become available to almost everyone regardless of their device capabilities or their accessibility needs. Well, that&#8217;s in theory. The reality is completely dependent on developers being aware of best practices and prioritising them. HTML presentation elements are rendered by a wide range of browsers on varied devices including desktop with mouse and keyboard input, portable touch enabled devices with sizes from watches to tablets, and even hybrids such as 2 in ones. In addition to device variability, the Web standards and best practices support human and context variability through carefully baked in accessibility.</p>
<p>The move to micro (and nano FaaS) service architectures on the back end should have limited impact on this webbiness as they are internal details of the servers.  However, the protocols used between client and server are RESTful in the web world, or rather, RESTful communications are the lifeblood of the web. Newer developments like GraphQL start to move away from the web&#8217;s RESTful architecture by effectively using one part of HTTP as a transport (somewhat like SOAP). However, this largely a detail of interest to developers only as far as most web users are concerned.</p>
<p>On the face of it the use of client-side generated presentation with AJAX or a SPA should make no difference to webbiness either. True, dynamic creation of the UI is open to developers playing fast and loose with the standards. And accessibility is often being the first casualty. But this is just as possible when content is generated on the server.</p>
<p>A big difference between SPAs and HTML apps is that browser developers put enormous effort into ensuring bad HTML and CSS fail gracefully across supported devices. JavaScript, on the other hand, is NOT fail safe. An error means it crashes and the user probably gets a nasty surprise. Individual developers or client side JavaScript framework developers have to effectively duplicate the effort that browser vendors go to in order to get as rugged an UX. Thus the user experience may not be as  consistent or as accessible with a SPA.</p>
<p>Another issue is that developers want to use the latest and greatest browser features, often in order to give a great UX. For example Service Workers allow developers to provide a great offline experience. As the rate of change accelerates the chances of a user having an old browser that doesn&#8217;t support a shiny new feature increases. This is much more exaggerated with features accessed through JavaScript code compared to HTML as the speed and focus is currently there. Even the JavaScript language itself is rapidly evolving witch new features developers are keen to use. So, unless there&#8217;s careful design to work with a range of devices users may be left stranded.</p>
<p>An established technique to avoid these problems is Progressive Enhancement where a basic HTML experience is available and UX enhancements are layered on for users with browsers that support the latest CSS and JavaScript shininess. But, with SPAs there is no initial HTML rendering for less able browsers. Lately techniques such as serverside rendering and Universal (isomorphic) JavaScript restore this to a large extent. Interestingly, the drive for these techniques has been SEO (Google can&#8217;t spider a client side app)  and time to initial display content of, rather than PE concerns.</p>
<p>In summary, then, the architectural shifts we are seeing do provide new ways to break the carefully designed universal nature of the web and exclude users of some devices or with some accessibility needs. However by carefully following inclusive design thinking at the system level these can be minimised. The shape of web app architectures may be changing but we can ensure the core principles remain in our minds as we develop.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following on from my earlier post on the topic of <a href="/2015/12/writing-portable-npm-build-scripts/">writing portable npm scripts</a>, here&#8217;s a few more useful tips.</p>
<p>[UPDATE 2016/03/31: Bash for Windows was announced at Microsoft Build 2016. This exciting feature will allow running of Linux npm script builds with ease. See <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevelopersCanRunBashShellAndUsermodeUbuntuLinuxBinariesOnWindows10.aspx">Scott Hanselman&#8217;s blog post</a>]</p>
<p>[UPDATE: 2016/03/29:  The recently released <a href="https://blog.docker.com/2016/03/docker-for-mac-windows-beta/">Docker for Windows Beta</a> might be a good alternative to using a VM. It user Hyper-V.]</p>
<p>[UPDATE: 2016/03/29:  This is a comprehensive article on <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/">using npm for build</a>]</p>
<h1>Copying files</h1>
<p>Use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ncp">ncp </a>module to copy files. This goes nicely with mkdirp and rimraf  mentioned before.</p>
<h1>Setting environment variables</h1>
<p>It&#8217;s common to have scripts with a command line of the form</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">NODE_ENV=production webpack --config client/webpack.config.js</pre><p>This sets the environment variable NODE_ENV for the duration the command runs. In this case it is use to perform a production build with webpack.</p>
<p>Such syntax works fine in bash etc on Linux / OS X but fails on windows where npm scripts always use CMD. One solution is to use the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env">cross-env</a> npm module which uses a regx to find environment settings (and so is probably not fool-proof). Once installed you just prefix your command like so</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">cross-env NODE_ENV=production webpack --config client/webpack.config.js</pre><p></p>
<h1>Running an extra bash process</h1>
<p>I use the <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/">Git for Windows</a> bash shell for all my development CLI needs on Windows (It is also installed as part of the <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop for Windows</a>). This is a port of the mature MSYS / MinGW port of Linux build environments and works pretty well, though some of the commands are old versions.</p>
<p>On Windows, npm ignores the current shell from which you run it and doesn&#8217;t pass the shell on to the sub processes as you would expect. However, you can easily run bash as the main command in a npm script (it&#8217;s an extra process but that hardly matters). This works as bash sets the path which is then inherited by the cmd subshell in which npm runs your package.json scripts. As a result it&#8217;s easy enough to create portable scripts or convert linux based scripts to also run on Windows. You just need to wrap the command in <pre class="crayon-plain-tag">bash -c "...."</pre> For example, the above env setting script can be recoded as follows</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">bash -c"NODE_ENV=production webpack --config client/webpack.config.js"</pre><p>The only issue i found is the need to carefully quote &#8221; characters. For example here&#8217;s a little script to prompt before deploying to GitHub pages (I&#8217;m showing the full package.json entry for clarity)</p><pre class="crayon-plain-tag">"deploy": "bash -c \"read -n1 -p\\\"Have you commited ready to deploy (yY) \\\"; echo; [[ $REPLY = [yY] ]] &amp;&amp; npm run _buildanddeploy || { echo \\\"You didn't answer yes, or deploy failed.\\\"; }",</pre><p></p>
<h1>Using a Linux VM</h1>
<p>I often use a Linux VM as part of my development. With Vagrent it&#8217;s easy to provision a headless VirtualBox (or other) VM that shares the host filespace and exposes a SSH terminal. Thus you can edit using Windows tools like VisualStudio Code yet run everything in the Linux VM. This lets you run local tests in the same VM as a CI or CD system (which will usually be Linux , unless you are using Azure). One easy configuration I&#8217;ve used is this <a href="https://github.com/GPII/qi-development-environments">Quality Infrastructure</a> from the GPII project.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>tl;dr; Developers need to <b>install and </b><b>build</b> Javascript NPM modules on Windows as well as *nix. With a little care this is possible without using heavyweights tools like Grunt and Gulp .</strong></p>
<p>Modern HTML development usually includes a build and deploy process similar to those used in compiled development workflows. In this case, assets that end up deployed and accessed by end users are the result of a pipeline of operations such as transpiling, concatenation, minifying and zipping. In addition,  developers use these and others steps when developing, for example as part of test automation,  on check-in or as part of  continuous integration and deployment process. Perhaps somewhat surprisingly, the traditional build tools such as shell scripts, configure and Make (or Ant) are not commonplace. Rather, we often see newer JavaScript based tools like Grunt, Gulp or Broccoli being the &#8220;go-to&#8221; choice. Critically, these tools do have the advantage of largely working cross-platform on Linux/OS X and Windows.</p>
<p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/npmlogo.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-634"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-634" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/npmlogo-300x200.jpg" alt="npm logo" width="300" height="200" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/npmlogo-300x200.jpg 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/npmlogo-768x512.jpg 768w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/12/npmlogo.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></a></p>
<p>An alternative build option is to use <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts">NPM’s scripts feature</a> in the project or module package.json. You can use commands like ‘npm run test’ to invoke important build processes. This has the advantage of putting the scripts in the same place as the rest of your project configuration. Also, actions may be broken up into sub actions or invoked though life-cycle triggers (like &#8220;before publish&#8221;). Unfortunately though, while NPM tracks module dependencies, these are not used in the scripts to minimize the required build steps (as Make does). Perhaps that will come in time, but until then, either everything gets built every time or you’ll need to call a build tool like Make from scripts. One issue with While is while it is very effective it has a rather gnarly syntax and plenty of awkward features that you need to get to grips with. That said, common useful rules are simply implemented. Another tool, Webpack looks interesting for building as it manages dependencies and also works with modules rather than files, as Make does.</p>
<p>Both Make and NPM scripts simply evoke the native command line shell to perform the actions for each build step and this raises an issue when you want to have your build work across platforms. The problem is that the shells have different syntax and command sets so you have to restrict npm scripts to a least common subset. Fortunately you can manage portability  with care. Evens  so, plenty of published modules exist that assume they are built on a *Nix Bash shell and so break on Windows. You might think you could get away with running one of the Bash shell systems for Windows (eg MSys, cygwin) but NPM always launches a Cmd shell (you can work around this by having your scripts run an extra bash shell, but that’s a bit hacky). More importantly using bash requires target build system configuration with yet another tool. We’d ideally like our build to work with just node (and thus npm) installed.</p>
<p>So assuming we have to write NPM scripts that run on both Bash and Cmd what can you do to reduce problems?</p>
<ul>
<li>Separate commands in a single script with &amp;&amp; (&#8220;and if no error&#8221;) or || (&#8220;or if error&#8221;) instead of  the terminator (; or : ). Remember you can invoke subscripts with “npm run xxx”</li>
<li>Modules like “concurrently” and “npm-run-all” add further task management options</li>
<li>Operators &amp;&amp; || &amp; &lt; &gt; and | all work pretty much the same in cmd and bash and offer a lot of power</li>
<li>Paths are a pain. While Windows system calls support the / separator it is also used for command options. Avoid as much as possible</li>
<li>In npm scripts “node_modules/.bin” is on the path so any CLI command modules installed with &#8211;save or –save-dev will available to scripts when the package is installed. For example “rimraf”, “mkdirp” and “ncp”. This avoids tell devs to do global installs of tools which may conflict with other tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course JavaScript itself is an ideal platform independent script tool so you could use <a href="http://www.ctomczyk.pl/why-i-switched-to-only-nodejs-npm-and-stopped-using-grunt/767/">nodejs to create build scripts</a> called from your NPM scripts. And after all, that is what Grunt and Gulp do by providing a full on framework for build services. The choice as always, is yours. A useful approach is to use the &#8220;<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/shelljs">Shelljs</a>&#8221; module that provides a unix style set of functions as an alternative to using the bash shell directly. In addition &#8220;Node-glob&#8221; provides wildcard expansions.</p>
<p>As a final thought, modules are usually distributed in source form and some contain native module source that must be compiled using a toolchain of Python and C++. Fortunately this is getting easier on Windows as described in Microsoft&#8217;s new <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejs-guidelines">nodejs Guidelines for Windows</a>.</p>
