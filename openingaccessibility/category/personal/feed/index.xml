				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I just installed Richard Sheperd&#8217;s <a href="http://www.twentytenfive.com/">TwentyTenFive</a> HTML5 version of the default WordPress theme and Sylvia Egger&#8217;s <a href="http://accessible.sprungmarker.de/2011/04/accessible-five">Accessible Five</a> accessibility enhancing child theme.</p>
<p>There was a <a href="http://accessible.sprungmarker.de/2011/04/accessible-five/#comment-548">slight glitch</a> with the name of the TwentyTenFive folder name having changed, but all seems well now after I renamed it back to &#8216;TwentyTenFive&#8217;.</p>
<p>We can just hope these both quickly make into WP core. Especially as there was a recent <a href="http://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2011/05/06/if-anyone-would-like-to-take-a-stroll-th/">call for WP accessibility</a> contributions.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So I&#8217;ve finally set up a new blog to replace that which was lost when EduSpaces pulled the plug on the old Elgg community where I hung out. I should have moved on anyway given my focus is now open accessibility, whereas at that time I was working in education (Exeter College MIS). Unfortunately my blog export turns out to be corrupt so it will be some time before I can resurrect some of those old posts.</p>
<p>Since then I&#8217;ve been pretty active on Twitter as <a href="http://twitter.com/SteveALee">@SteveALee</a> and whilst being socially powerful, doing so really depletes the blogging muse. Still at times there is more I want to say than can be pared down to fit the lean and mean 140.</p>
<p>I also work  for UK JISC funded FE/HE educational advisory service <a href="http://oss-watch.ac.uk/">OSS Watch</a> and I occasionally <a href="http://osswatch.jiscinvolve.org/">blog there</a> as well.</p>
<p>So now I&#8217;m all set to go. I had intended this to be a Drupal blog, partly to gain familiarity with the excellent CMS with a view to using it for a refresh of fullmeasure.co.uk, and partly as the <a href="http://groups.drupal.org/accessibility">Drupal Accessibility community</a> are doing great things, many of which have landed in Drupal 7.  However, my otherwise excellent and open source friendly hoster, <a href="http://ukfsn.org/">UKFSN</a> are still using a version of PHP that is too old for Drupal 7. So for now I knocked up a quick WordPress install. It&#8217;s such an easy out-of-the-box blog setup and it&#8217;s fresh in my mind as I&#8217;ve just used it for a <a href="http://grkflood.co.uk/">couple</a> of <a href="http://suigenerissolutions.co.uk/">websites</a> for a client.</p>
