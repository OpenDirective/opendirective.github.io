		<description><![CDATA[Sorry to hear that. Did you try running the bat from a commandline prompt? That way you&#039;ll see any errors.

I&#039;m no longer working on this so can only suggest you contact the Firefox OS community for advise.

Good luck]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; First chat is not a â€˜dâ€™ (for directory) means it consumes other file encodings like symbolic links, block device etc. as well? (c.f. http://bashshell.net/file-permissions-and-attributes/understanding-linux-file-types/)

Oops a bug. However I doubt the others crop up often in Tar archives :)

&gt; Hm, I wonder, what would happen, if there are strange characters in between

Well . matches just about everything.

&gt; NF is a built-in variable whose value is the number of fields

Aha - thanks.]]></description>

Hm, I wonder, what would happen, if there are strange characters in between â€¦ but that becomes academic :)

		<description><![CDATA[Yes you are right! Awk is brilliant if you need to work on columns and rows. It&#039;s a little bit like SQL in that it&#039;s not a procedural approach. That line is a complete awk program - many are that small. They are of the form of multiple

  Pattern { action }

which are applied to each line (row) so when pattern matches action is performed. $ is used to reference columns from $1 to $NF (last - I&#039;ve no idea why NF). 

~ means match regex. A = would be an exact match. !~ is doesn&#039;t match.

Thus it boils  down to - when the the 1st column ($1) matches 1st char is not a &#039;d&#039; ([^d]) and last is a &#039;x&#039;(x$) then print &quot;/system&quot;/&lt;filename in last column&gt;.

See https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/gawk.html

Note in regex [] set letters are literal so [^d] is &quot;not d&quot; and not &#039;digit&#039;.

You might be right - restricting .* could be better  but I think $ sorts it out as it as * is maximal match in awk (I hope) ;)

		<description><![CDATA[Hello, Steve,

thanks for permitting my comment.

Could you break the awk command down? I&#039;m familiar to RegEx, but awk is ... well awkward to me.

From what I understand, &lt;code&gt;awk &#039;$1 ~ /^[^d].*x$/ {print &quot;/system/&quot; $NF}&#039;&lt;/code&gt; splits the line at whitespace, fetches the first field (the line with e.g. &lt;code&gt;drwxrwxrwx&lt;/code&gt; displaying the permission flags for user/group/others), looks for something beginning (^) with no digit ([^d]), followed by an arbitrary set (.*) of characters (why not restricting?) ending on x (x$) and then prints the match after a &quot;/string/&quot;.

Am I right?
What does ~ do here?

Regards,


AndrÃ©]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[AndrÃ© Thank you for taking the time to comment. 2 points here.
1) It&#039;s not all files - just those marked executable in the .tar.gz archive (that&#039;s what awk is doing)
2) I did adb shell ls -l to see what they were set to on the device when flashed from linux and I got 777
I agree it seems a bit rash.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,

just a N.B. from just another GNU/Linux user: Are you sure you want to set the rwx-Flag (read, write, execute) for all files for everyone?

It may be considered a security risk.
