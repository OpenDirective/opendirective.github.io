		<description><![CDATA[Thanks Amanda, Denise. It&#039;s create to know Cubase is still going and is accessible enough with Tobii and perhaps similar systems. For Windows, there is also the OpenSource (free) &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/OptiKey/OptiKey/wiki&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;OptiKey&lt;/a&gt; which might be useful, or perhaps the developer would be willing to make changes.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Denise. I am a mother of a child with CP who uses the Tobii for communication on PC and I am also a musician who has had extensive studio exxperience including running a home studio. I wonder if your son would use Cubase on PC with Tobii for the time being until better eyegaze access to Macs is developed? It&#039;s not as &#039;industry standard&#039; as Protools but is a great program and will do basically the same thing as Protools. Just a suggestion. Hope he gets it all up and running. I hope my son can access music through his eye gaze in the future, too. He is only 11 but is very musical and has perfect pitch and a great ear. All the best.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Joan, I&#039;m not sure who is using eyegaze with OS X / iOS. Perhaps drop Mick at http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/ a line? I do know cheaper hardware solutions are now becoming available but the software may be mostly Windows Based See http://www.smartboxat.com/]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am very interested in learning more about this option, as I am trying to source eye gaze technology for a Mac/iPad for a young man who has cerebral palsy, and has a Mac system.

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the info. Now Tobii have unbundled their eye tracking hardware we have quite a few options.There are other makes as well.

A couple of comments:
* You can run virtual machines on a decent PC, not necessarily a server class machine
* &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vmware.com/products/player/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VMWare Player&lt;/a&gt; is free and you can create VMs as well as play them.
* &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.virtualbox.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;VirtualBox&lt;/a&gt; is an alternative to VMWare that is largely free and open source
* You can also run OS X directly on non-Mac hardware - see &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hackintosh.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Hackintosh&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
