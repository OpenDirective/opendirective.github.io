		<description><![CDATA[Hi there

just bought and installed the radio. I like it already. Will replace my Revo K2 because of last.fm will stop streaming radio on April 28, 2014.

With regards to iMac connection. I do use an app called &quot;Playback&quot; from Yazsoft which needs to be installed on your Mac. It accesses the iTunes library and becomes visible on your Revo Pixis. Streams perfectly playlists, interpreted, albums und genres.

Right now my Pixis does not deliver the Frontier Silicon Portal code, so I can&#039;t sync my internet radio stations. The search stops with a timeout message. Maybe the Revo servers are down ... no idea. I will try after the Easter holidays.

Other than that I&#039;m impressed with the sound and usability.

		<description><![CDATA[Richard, apologies for my delay in responding. No, not really, the size of the text of the Snooze is small and the way it operates could be simpler.

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for your valuable review of the Revo Pixis. 

I&#039;m thinking of buying one but have two concerns. Firstly, is the snooze control easy to operate? When I&#039;m only half awake, I want to be able to stretch out my hand with eyes still closed and hit a large button. I don&#039;t want to have to put my specs on to operate the touch screen. Secondly, does the clock have a 12-hour a.m. / p.m. option, rather than just a 24?

Thanks

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t use iTunes myself as I prefer to directly manage media and I have nagging feeling that it&#039;s main purpose is to direct our cash into Apple&#039;s coffers :)

That said, assuming you are wanting to access local media files managed by iTunes you will almost certainly want to run a UPnP server that can access the files (media play performs this function on Windows). The Pixis should then be able to access your media via the UPnP standard interface. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://revo.co.uk/support/owners-guide-downloads/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;Pixis RS&lt;/a&gt; manual mentions something called EyeConnect.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Peter. By default when the radio is &#039;off&#039; the clock is displayed and alarms active. There is a setting to make the display blank after a period in standby. That is why it is off for me. What is missing is a large clock display when the radio is playing

You can download. the manual from the Revo website.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[* Hi I was looking into purchasing this model as an alarm clock...you stated that the Pixis display is off when the unit is not used during the night? How does the alarm function work? (is it operational when the time is set to go off?)

* I would like the display to be off at night, (so the display light is not too bright) and would prefer it to switch on when the alarm goes off. * I assume there is a setting where the display can be turned off when in standby?]]></description>
